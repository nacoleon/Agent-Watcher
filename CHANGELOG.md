# Changelog

All notable changes to the PokéWatcher firmware will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **#1 Dual queue consumers**: mood_engine_task and coordinator_task both consumed from the same FreeRTOS queue, causing ~50% of events to be delivered to the wrong consumer. Removed coordinator_task; mood engine now dispatches all event types via callbacks.
- **#2 Renderer thread safety**: sprite data, animation state, and frame buffer were accessed from multiple tasks without synchronization, causing use-after-free crashes. Added a mutex to serialize all renderer state access.
